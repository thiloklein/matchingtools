# This is an **example** API to demontstrate features of OpenAPI specification.
# It doesn't cover all OpenAPI features. For more full example check out: https://github.com/APIs-guru/petstore_extended

swagger: '2.0'
# You should specify common part of your endpoints in the following format:
#   <schemes>://<host><basepath>
schemes:
  - https # Remove if your API donsn't support HTTPS
host: api.matchingtools.org # Replace with your hostname. 
basePath: / # Replace with your basePath. Note: SHOULD begin with '/'.

  # Describe your API here, you can use GFM (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) here

    The **MatchingTools** API implements matching algorithms using the OpenAPI specification.
    # Introduction
    This specification is describing the API in 
    [OpenAPI/Swagger format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md).
    
    # OpenAPI Specification
    The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which
    allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source
    code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can 
    understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what
    interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the guesswork in calling the service.

  version: '1.0.0' # Your API version
  # It can be any string but it is better to use semantic versioning: http://semver.org/
  # Warning: OpenAPI require version to be string, but without quotation YAML can recognize it as number.

  title: MatchingTools API # Replace with your API title
  # Keep it simple. Don't add "API" or verison at the end of the string.
